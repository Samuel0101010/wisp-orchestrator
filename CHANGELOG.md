# Changelog

## 1.0.0 — Personal-use complete

The plan written 2026-05-05 finished as scoped: M1 vertical slice,
M1.5 hardening, plus M2-M5 feature work, plus four `/harness-*`
plugin skills. Six real-Claude validation runs documented under
`docs/real-run-notes.md` (~$15-25 in subscription quota total).

### Added — M2: variable team

- `Team` is a `{roles: AgentSpec[]}` array (1..8 roles, kebab-case
  unique names matching `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$`, model enum
  `opus|sonnet|haiku`, systemPrompt 40-4000 chars).
- Drizzle migration `0002_variable_team.sql` rewrites legacy
  `{architect,developer,qa}` rows in place (idempotent).
- Planner `DAG_SCHEMA_BLOCK` describes the new shape; planner prompt
  enumerates configured role names verbatim with cardinality.
- Walker resolves agent via `team.roles.find(r => r.role === ...)`;
  emits `task.failed` with "role 'X' not in team" when the lookup
  misses (checked before worktree allocation).
- Server team route validates the new shape; 6 new endpoint tests.
- Web `TeamBuilder` rewrite: `TeamRoleCard` + `TeamRoleAddButton`
  components, model dropdown, per-role remove, inline duplicate
  detection blocks Save.

### Added — M3: shared-memory MCP

- New workspace package `@agent-harness/memory-mcp`: stdio MCP
  server exposing `memory.{set,get,list,delete}` backed by per-run
  SQLite WAL.
- Walker spawns the server per task via `claude -p --mcp-config
  --strict-mcp-config`. `SubprocessPool.defaultMcpConfigPath`
  injects the config path so the walker stays oblivious.
- Per-run config + DB live under `<HARNESS_DATA_DIR>/{mcp-configs,
  memory}/<runId>.{json,db}`.
- Default team `allowedTools` include the fully-qualified
  `mcp__agent-harness-memory__memory_set/get/list` (delete
  intentionally excluded).
- `docs/memory-mcp.md` — usage, security note, on-disk layout,
  inspection guide.

### Added — M4: team templates

- Four built-in templates: `ts-library` (4 roles), `python-backend`
  (4), `refactor-squad` (3), `data-pipeline` (4). Validated against
  `templateSchema` at module load.
- `GET /api/team-templates` returns built-ins + on-disk user
  templates merged & sorted (on-disk wins on id collision).
- `POST /api/team-templates` writes to
  `<HARNESS_DATA_DIR>/templates/<id>.json`.
- Web `TemplatePicker` in NewProject dialog (max-h-48, scrollable).
  Goal pre-fills from template's first `suggestedGoal`. "Save as
  Template" Dialog on TeamBuilder.
- `apps/dashboard-server/scripts/copy-templates.mjs` ferries
  template JSONs into `dist/` on build.

### Added — M5: QA-driven replan

- New `parent_plan_id` column on plans (Drizzle migration 0003).
- Walker `replanOnQAFailure` callback. When a `qa`-role task fails
  terminally, walker calls server's `replan.ts` helper which
  composes an extended goal with the QA error context, runs
  `generatePlan`, persists a child plan with `parent_plan_id`
  pointing at the failed plan, and returns it for the walker to
  swap in. Capped at 1 replan per run (`MAX_REPLANS_PER_RUN`).
- Branches namespaced by `v<N>` after replan: v1 keeps the original
  `harness/<runId>/<taskId>` form; v2+ get `harness/<runId>/vN/<taskId>`
  to avoid `git worktree add -b` collisions on reused task ids.
- Two new events: `qa.replan-triggered`, `qa.replan-exhausted`.
- `GET /api/plans/:id/chain` walks `parent_plan_id` ancestors
  newest-first.
- Web `PlanVersionBadge` renders "v2 (replanned)" for chain >1, with
  ancestor list in the title attribute. Mounted in PlanEditor +
  RunView.
- `generatePlan` extracted from `routes/plans.ts` into
  `apps/dashboard-server/src/orchestrator/planner-runner.ts` so the
  runtime can call it without going through HTTP.

### Added — Stage 1: foundation hardening

- New `harness.verify-failed` event with `{taskId, attempt,
  failures: [{kind, cmd, exitCode, tail}], output}` payload —
  replaces opaque `exit code 1` with full forensics.
- `composeTaskPrompt` truncates retry-error context to first 30 +
  last 60 lines with `[… N omitted …]` marker (was inflating retry
  prompts to thousands of lines).
- `successCriteria.preflight` runs once before build/test/lint and
  short-circuits the rest on failure with `kind: 'preflight'`.
- `task.usage` parser reads modern `{type:'result', usage:{...},
  num_turns}` frame (token telemetry was always 0/0 before).
- `verification.ts` `defaultExec` injects `CI=true` + `npm_config_os`
  + `npm_config_arch` so pnpm install works correctly across
  worktree-chained `node_modules` and stale global pnpm config.

### Added — Stage 6: plugin skills

- Four `SKILL.md` files under `skills/`: `harness-new-run`,
  `harness-resume`, `harness-inspect`, `harness-diagnose`. The
  dashboard is now optional for the most common workflows.
- `GET /api/runs/:runId/events?limit=&type=` for the diagnose skill.
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` bumped to register the `skills`
  directory.

### Changed

- Plugin manifest version bumped to `1.0.0`.

## 0.1.5 — M1.5 Foundation hardening (released as part of M1.5 PR)

### Fixed

- Walker now chains downstream worktrees off parent task branches and
  auto-commits each task's output, so a real Claude run produces
  consolidated artifacts in `<repoPath>` instead of evaporating with
  the worktree (Stage A).
- Rate-limit pause no longer auto-resumes by default
  (`HARNESS_AUTO_RESUME_RATE_LIMIT` to opt in); auth-probe failure
  blocks `POST /api/runs` with HTTP 503; walker pauses with
  `pausedReason='consecutive-failures'` after 3 consecutive task
  failures.

### Changed

- Balanced runtime defaults — `maxParallel=2` (was 3),
  `budgetMinutes=120` (was 360), `interTaskPacingMs=5000` (new).

### Added

- `tests/compliance` — static guards forbidding direct Anthropic
  endpoints, `x-api-key` headers, and credential file access. CI verify
  step includes the new package.
- Per-project daily-runs counter in sidebar; one-time first-run
  acknowledgment modal explaining ToS responsibility.
- `docs/anthropic-compliance.md`; README "Anthropic Terms of Service"
  section.
- `HARNESS_AUTO_RESUME_RATE_LIMIT`, `HARNESS_INTER_TASK_PACING_MS`,
  `HARNESS_AUTH_MODE` env vars.
- Diamond-dep merge support: multi-parent tasks merge other parents
  into the dependent task's worktree via `git merge --no-ff`.
- Final result branch `harness/<runId>/result` consolidating all leaf
  task branches at run end.

## 0.1.0 - M1 vertical slice (unreleased)

The first end-to-end milestone: a single goal can drive a 3-role team through plan generation, execution, and verification, with full pause/resume across rate-limit windows and server restarts.

### Added

- Claude Code plugin manifest (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`) plus four agent specs in `agents/` (architect, developer, qa, planner), the `/harness-dashboard` slash-command, `hooks/hooks.json` with `PreCompact` + `SessionStart` wiring, and cross-platform launcher scripts in `scripts/`.
- `packages/schemas` — Drizzle schema with 9 tables (`projects`, `teams`, `plans`, `tasks`, `runs`, `events`, `checkpoints`, `rate_windows`) plus Zod schemas for `Plan`, `HarnessEvent`, `AgentSpec`, `Team`, including `validateDag` for structural plan invariants.
- `packages/orchestrator`:
  - `runClaude` subprocess runner that spawns `claude -p`, parses NDJSON to `HarnessEvent`s, and supports a `__mockBin` test seam.
  - `SubprocessPool` with `terminateAll` for graceful cancellation.
  - `Walker` — DAG dispatch with pause/resume, rate-limit auto-resume timer, budget caps, single-retry policy, and resume-after-shutdown via `initialState`.
  - `runVerification` (E1) running `build`/`test`/`lint`/`custom` shell gates with per-command timeouts.
  - `addWorktree` / `removeWorktree` git helpers for per-task isolation.
  - `probeSubscriptionAuth` and `detectRateLimit` heuristics.
- `apps/dashboard-server`:
  - Fastify 5 + `@fastify/cors` + `@fastify/websocket`.
  - Routes: `/api/health`, projects (CRUD), teams (per project), plans (generate, get, patch, lock), runs (start, get, pause, resume, cancel, replay-checkpoint, list-by-project, global list with `?resumable=true`).
  - `RunRuntime` wiring Walker into DB + WS, with per-run snapshots every 10 minutes.
  - Bootstrap that runs migrations and recovers orphaned `running` runs to `paused`/`shutdown`.
  - Graceful shutdown that pauses every walker with `pausedReason='shutdown'` and closes Fastify + SQLite within a 30 s hard timeout.
- `apps/dashboard-web`:
  - Vite + React 19 + Tailwind v4 + shadcn.
  - Routes: TeamBuilder (3 role cards), PlanEditor (React Flow + dagre layout, side-panel inline edit), RunView (5-column kanban: pending/running/verifying/done/failed; live tail; resource bar; rate-limit countdown).
  - Sidebar with project list, new-project dialog, recent-runs preview.
  - TopBar mirrors run resource bar.
- Documentation: `README.md` rewrite, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/agents.md`, `docs/development.md`, this `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Notes

- Subscription-only auth: every subprocess inherits `~/.claude/` and has `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` actively unset.
- Token usage is informational only; the gated budgets are wallclock minutes, total turns, and parallel pool size.
- 167 unit tests plus 1 Playwright end-to-end smoke test (mock-CLI mode) green at M1 close. All packages typecheck and build.

### M1 review fixes (post-close)

- Fixed: rate-limit pauses no longer auto-resume after server restart; `fixUpAbruptCrashes` rewrites them to `paused/shutdown` so the user explicitly resumes (C1).
- Fixed: `task.usage` now treated as cumulative (`Math.max`) on per-task counters; run-level totals updated by delta to match `claude -p --output-format stream-json` semantics (H1).
- Fixed: dropped unused `'concerns' | 'fail'` task-outcome enum values; `task.completed` is `'pass'` only in M1 (H2).
- Fixed: bootstrap now runs a one-shot subscription-auth probe and surfaces the result via `GET /api/health.authProbe` (skipped when `HARNESS_MOCK_CLI=1`); never fails bootstrap (H3).
- Fixed: `teams.rolesJson` stores the slotted `Team` object directly; dropped the legacy array<->object conversion helpers (H4).
- Fixed: walker forwards the per-task abort signal to `runVerification` so cancel/pause halts verifier subprocesses promptly (M1).
- Fixed: documented `runVerification` SIGTERM→SIGKILL escalation (5s grace via execa's `forceKillAfterTimeout`); migrated to execa v9's `cancelSignal` option (M2).
- Fixed: `walker.cancel()` removes worktrees of currently-running tasks on user-cancel; preserves them on `budget_exceeded` for forensics; also calls `pool.terminateAll()` for slot hygiene (M3, L1).
- Fixed: resume path logs structured `resume-no-session` warning when a task with a worktree but no `sessionId` is restarted from scratch (M4).
- Fixed: server-side `emit` filter drops `task.tool-use` events from persistence and WS broadcast; schema entry preserved for future tool-timeline UI (M5).
- Documented planner-event audit gap: events broadcast for live UI, not persisted (no parent `runs` row); listed under architecture.md "Known limitations" (M6).
- Fixed: `recompute()` in `apps/dashboard-web/src/store/run.ts` no longer constructs a dead `aggregates` object (L2).
- Fixed: `PATCH /api/plans/:planId` returns 400 `empty-patch` when `dagJson` is missing (L3).
- Fixed: `scripts/launch-dashboard.ps1` uses `-NoNewWindow` instead of the conflicting `-WindowStyle Hidden` (L5).
